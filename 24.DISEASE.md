  # Dieting System based on Disease.
# AIM:
To Write a Prolog Program to suggest Dieting System based on Disease.
# PROGRAM::

    disease(diabetes, 'Low sugar, high fiber diet').
    disease(hypertension, 'Low sodium diet').
    disease(obesity, 'Balanced diet with calorie control').
    disease(cholesterol, 'Low saturated fat diet').
    disease(celiac, 'Gluten-free diet').
    disease(lactose_intolerance, 'Lactose-free diet').

    suggest_diet(Disease, Diet) :-
        disease(Disease, Diet).

    list_diseases :-
        findall(Disease-Diet, disease(Disease, Diet), Diseases),
        print_diseases(Diseases).

    print_diseases([]).
    print_diseases([Disease-Diet | Rest]) :-
        format('For ~w: ~w~n', [Disease, Diet]),
        print_diseases(Rest).
