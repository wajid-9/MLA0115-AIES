    Create the text for your link and add a hyperlink on it like you would normally for any other link.
    Create anchor link with HTML
    Create an anchor link with HTML
    
#Step 2

 Instead of linking it to a URL, post, or page; you will assign it an anchor name.
 URIs that designate anchors contain a “#” character followed by the anchor name.
 You can name this anything you want, although we typically recommend keeping them short and related to the actual name of the header.
 If you look at the text view (HTML) it looks like this:

    <a href="#manually-create-anchor-links-wordpress">How to Manually Create Anchor Links in WordPress</a>
    Here is an example all of the anchor links we’re using in this post:

    <ul>
    <li><a href="#manually-create-anchor-links-wordpress">How to Manually Create Anchor Links in WordPress</a></li>
    <li><a href="#anchor-links-wordpress-plugin">How to Create Anchor Links in WordPress with a Plugin</a></li>
    <li><a href="#anchor-links-wordpress-gutenberg">How to Create Anchor Links in WordPress with Gutenberg</a></li>
    </ul>
    
#Step 3

Next, you need to add an ID on the header you want your anchor link to jump to. To do this you’ll need to switch over to the text view (HTML) in the WordPress editor. On the header, in this case, an H2 header, add the ID along with the anchor name you chose in step 2. The anchor name and ID attribute have to be exactly the same for the link to work.
