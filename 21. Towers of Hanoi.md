# Towers of Hanoi. 
# AIM:
To  Write a Prolog Program to implement Towers of Hanoi. 
# PROGRAM::

    move(1, Source, Target, _) :-
        write('Move disk from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Target), nl.


    move(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
            N > 1,
        M is N - 1,
        move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Target),  % Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
        move(1, Source, Target, _),          % Move the largest disk from Source to Target
        move(M, Auxiliary, Target, Source).  % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Target


    solve_towers_of_hanoi(N) :-
          move(N, 'A', 'C', 'B').  % A is the source, C is the target, B is the auxiliary
