- Base case: The sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0 sum(0, 0).
- Recursive case: The sum of the first N natural numbers sum(N, Total) :- N > 0, % Ensure N is positive N1 is N - 1, % Decrement N sum(N1, Subtotal), % Recursive call to sum(N1, Subtotal) Total is N + Subtotal. % Total is the sum of N and the subtotal
